There is already a list of identified future updates.
Community contributions are welcomed.

1) Add more sensor support. Specifically on STRIPMAP SAR datasets

2) External DEM support configurable via python scripts. Already possible modifying provided graphs directly.

3) Applied Orbit configurable via python scripts. Already possible modifying provided graphs directly. Possible to include script for downloading Precise or Restituted Orbits directly.

4) Multi subswath integration. Current scripts do not support 2 or 3 subswath interferograms.

5) Prepare scripts for StaMPS SBAS
